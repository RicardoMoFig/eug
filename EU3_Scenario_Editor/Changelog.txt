/=================\
|=== Changelog ===|
\=================/

=== 0.8.10 ===

- Added base production and base manpower views for EU4 1.12.
- Start dates in defines.lua can now be overridden by files in common\defines.


=== 0.8.9 ===

- Fixed crash when loading Clausewitz 1 (HOI3, Victoria non-AHD) mods.


=== 0.8.8 ===

- Fixed crash on startup when config.txt is missing.
- Auto-update checks are now turned on by default.
- Added logging if an unexpected error happens.


=== 0.8.7 ===

- Zipped saves can now be loaded. Making any changes will result in a non-zipped
  save, so be warned.
- Implemented automatic version checking. On launch, the editor will attempt to
  read an XML version file hosted on SourceForge, and if a new version is
  available, the Help menu will draw attention to it. This behavior can be
  turned off by setting check_for_updates = no in config.txt. Manual version
  checking is always available via a new item in the Help menu.
- Implemented proper logging instead of printing to the console. It is no longer
  necessary to use the .bat file to capture error messages; all output is
  printed to output.log for easy access.

=== 0.7.4 ===

  the names defined in definition.csv.

Bugfixes:

=== 0.7.3 ===

Changed:
- Double-clicking a province now always opens the province editor, even in the
  political view.

Bugfixes:
- Forcing a reload should no longer freeze the editor for a long time.


=== 0.7.2 ===

Added:
- Colors of scaling mapmodes (e.g. population or base tax) are now editable.

Changed:

=== 0.7 ===

Now compatible with Heir to the Throne.
And Divine Wind.
And Victoria 2.
And HOI3.
And Rome.
Good enough?

Added:
- A few new view sets, mostly for the new games.
- There is now a button to display a table of wars. Double-clicking a row of the
  table pops up a file dialog. Saving changes is not supported yet.

Changed:
- Almost all mapmodes that show a single something (single country, single tech
  group, single trade good) now allow clicking to change the filter to whatever
  was clicked on. E.g. when viewing a trade good, clicking a province with gold
  switches the view to gold provinces.
- Parsing errors now display the file that the error occurred in.
- Reduced memory consumption of large saves. It's still a lot, though.
- Made some optimizations to the startup process.

Bugfixes:
- "extend" and "replace" entries in mod files are now properly case-insensitive.
- Fixed a couple of NullPointerExceptions on tooltips.


=== 0.6.1 ===

Added:

Changed:
- The date selectors no longer automatically start in 1453. If defines.txt has
  a start date in it (which it should in In Nomine), that will be the default.
- The goods menu will now break into multiple menus if there are more than 25
  trade goods.
- The wars screen should not be quite so large and unwieldy now.

Bugfixes:
- The tech group menu should now work properly in In Nomine.


=== 0.6 ===

Now In Nomine-compatible!

Added:
- New view set: Native types.
- New view set: Regions (for IN only).
- New view set: Tech groups.
- New view: Capitals of existing countries. Requested by dharper.
- Most views of single filters (e.g. "religion = orthodox") will now change
  when another country (or province, as the case may be) is clicked. For
  example, while the view is set to "trade_goods = grain", clicking any land
  province will change the filter to whatever the trade goods are in that
  province.
- Button to force reloading data (after things have been changed outside the
  program, for example). Requested by 17blue17.
- New menu item in the View Single Country menu to show the country's history.
  Now you don't have to find a time when the country is actually on the map.
- Added a way to edit war history files. Yes, the interface is a little awkward,
  but at least it's possible.

Changed:
- In view modes that had stripes (countries and religions), stripes are now
  diagonal. This matches the game more closely.
- If there are more than 20 governments defined, the Government view menu will
  now sort them into three categories: Republics, Religious, and Normal (i.e.
  none-of-the-above). If any of these categories has more than 25 entries, they
  will be split into sub-menus. Thanks to dharper for the idea and jdrou for
  suggesting how to do the government type division.
- Switching to a country-based map mode while a province is selected now
  re-selects it so that the country history button is activated as necessary.
- The .bat file now includes a "pause" line, so the command window should never
  just pop up and immediately disappear when there is a problem.

Bugfixes:
- Double-clicking a province while in country mode should now open the country
  history, as Readme.txt has said for a while.
- The initial window should never be larger than the screen.


=== 0.5.1 ===

Bugfixes:
- Editing country entries in saved games no longer corrupts the save. Found by
  an embarrassingly large number of people.
- Config editor now outputs mod names in quotes.
- Config editor now automatically puts "/mod/" before the mod name when
  checking if it exists. Found with help from Fornadan.


=== 0.5 ===

Added:
- Savegames are now supported! Requested by seboden, kolmy, and others.
- Bookmarks support. If a save game is loaded, there will be two bookmarks:
  game start and current year. If the history is loaded, all bookmarks will be
  loaded from bookmarks.txt.
- Config editor (config.bat). Requested by Charlone.
- New view set: Governments.
- New view: Country religions.
- New view set: Continents.
- New view set: Climates.
- Province borders are now shown in all views except the basic province view.

Changed:
- Totally reworked the text editor:
	- Multiple editors are now supported
	- Font is now customizable. It is saved in a new configuration file,
	  editor_cfg.txt .
	- Backups are now handled automatically (no user interaction).
	- Added menu items to show a list of countries, cultures, or provinces, so you
	  won't have to go digging around to figure out what province ID you want.
	  Note: Under Java 1.5 or earlier, the lists cannot be sorted.
	- Added find support (but only forward, and without replacing).
- Reworked the custom view creator. Country-based views are now possible.
- Optimized the history parser, greatly reducing lag on most map modes.

Bugfixes:
- Bracket matching in the editor no longer uses brackets that are commented out.
- Several other assorted fixes.


=== 0.4 ===

Added:
- About a gazillion new mapmodes. They are in the "View" menu.

Changed:
- Startup time is now about 1/3 of previous. There is no longer a progress bar
  shown.
- The "Go to province" button now can search by province name, also. If the
  province is found, it will flash (so you can see where it is).
* Editor:
	- The editor now never saves without asking.
	- The editor's OK button was renamed to Close, to be clear.
	- If syntax is invalid, hovering the mouse over the red message shows a tooltip
	  with the locations of any unmatched brackets.
	- Added "Go to line" menu item.
- Improved error messages when loading files.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed the second change from 0.3.1. The files were being reloaded, but were
  not showing up on the map.
- Assorted smaller fixes.


=== 0.3.1 ===

Changed:
- Files in the localisation directory will now only be parsed if their extension
  is ".csv".
- History files will now be reloaded after they are edited.

Bugfixes:
- Backup files now have the '~' at the beginning of the filename, not the end.
  This is because the game doesn't care about the extension of the history files,
  so it was sometimes loading the backups instead. Backup files created by
  previous versions should be removed.
  Thanks to English Patriot and seboden for discovering this.

=== 0.3 ===

Added:
- Support for walking through history like in the EU3 scenario setup screen.
  Note that after changing the date, you must click "Set date" for it to take
  effect. Reloading after every click on the date spinners would cause a bit
  of lag, so I left it this way.
  To support this feature, every province history file is loaded at startup,
  which takes a few seconds. A progress bar will appear, though, so it won't
  look as if it froze up. DO NOT switch to country mode before loading
  finishes; it will cause an exception.
- Can now edit country history files when in country mode.
- New button: "Go to province". It allows entering a province ID number to
  center the map on that province and select it.
- All buttons now appear on the toolbar and in the "Tools" menu.
- When in country mode, tooltips now include the owning country.
- When in country mode, double-clicking will open up the country's history file,
  not the province's.

Changed:
- If a province is selected, zooming in or out will keep that province in the
  center of the screen, if possible.
- When using a moddir and history is extended, if a history file doesn't exist
  in the mod's history file, the vanilla file will still be opened for editing,
  but if any changes are made, the file will be saved in the mod's history
  folder.

Bugfixes:
- When using a moddir and history is extended, if a history file doesn't exist
  in either the mod's history folder or the vanilla history folder, the new
  file will now be created in the mod's history folder.


=== 0.2.2 ===
(Not actually released as 0.2.2, but should have been)

Bugfixes:
- Now REALLY works with the full version of EU3. Thanks to seboden for
  pointing out the error and suggesting the fix.


=== 0.2.1 ===

Changed:
- config.txt now uses "maindir" instead of "eu3dir". If you have edited your
  config, you will need to change it.

Bugfixes:
- Should now work on full version of EU3.
- Double-clicking on Terra Incognita will no longer bring up an editor.


=== 0.2 ===

Added:
- Syntax highlighting for editing history files (done with an old package of
  jEdit (http://www.jedit.org) that is in the public domain, meaning no
  restrictions in copyright).
- Editor now supports cut, copy, paste, undo, and redo.
- Double-clicking a province now opens an editor.
- Hovering over a province now shows a tooltip with the province's name and ID.

Changed:
- Figuring out which province was clicked on is now much faster.
- If a province history file does not exist, a new one is created.
- Only one editor can be open at a time (workaround for an issue created by
  the new syntax highlighting text area).

Bugfixes:
- A few; can't remember specifics.


=== 0.1 ===

- Initial release
